# MoneyManagerProject
A small project that focused on writing modular, well-commented, code as well as testing that code.

The program uses a text interface to simulate opening up several types of money management accounts: Checking, Savings, Money Market; and then depositing and withdrawing from those accounts. The accounts will accrue interest as they are interacted with depending on the type of account they are. There are also features for displaying accounts and account holder information.

This project was created by Martin Colucci for Rutgers CS213 in Fall 2020
